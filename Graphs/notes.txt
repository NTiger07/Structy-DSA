Depth First Search: Stack (Last in first out)
Breadth First Search: Queue (First in first out)

DFS can be done iteratively and recursively
BFS can only be done iteratively

Typically, Graphs have:
    Time Complexity of O(e), where e is the number of edges
    Space Complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes
